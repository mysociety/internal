RewriteEngine on

# Don't need ".cgi" to refer to CGI scripts. Also, the mailmanlogin script
# needs to be able to impersonate the logged in user, so that it can access
# other scripts on this server. So pass the authenticated user's credentials to
# the script (usually Apache would hide them). This is a hack, and I am
# ashamed.
